						<p class="col50">After officially marrying with a modest ceremony, Ryan and Carrie are almost ready to move in. With so much happening at once and the renovation a little over budget, the coupleâ€™s finances are tighter than ever and Ryan takes out a small loan to help cover the cost of the wedding (about 15-20K). Soon after, the pair move in to their new home in Jurong West and begin anew phase of their journey together. Since getting approved on their BTO, Ryan has been researching cars as living further out in these less mature estates leaves them with limited transportation options. Ryan manages to find a second-hand car with a 7-year COE left on it. </p>
