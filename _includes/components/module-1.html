					<p>After hearing some distressing stories he decides to do some research on extra health and life insurance. Ryan has little in the way of savings as this stage in his life, and this is the first time heÂ has ever looked into any type of insurance on his own.  He knows that the stipend he gets from NS will only be enough to cover transportation costs. </p>
