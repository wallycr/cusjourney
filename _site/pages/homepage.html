            <p>Ryan’s Singaporean parents have traditional values when it comes to money: work hard and save up. As an adolescent, Ryan went to public school and excelled in math and science.</p>
            <p>Like many of his peers, during his upbringing Ryan felt pressured to excel academically and help launch his family to the next economic stratosphere. After completing his mandatory 2 years of service with the National Service, Ryan applied to the National University of Singapore (NUS) for Engineering and was awarded a STEM scholarship.</p>
            <p>While completing his undergraduate studies, Ryan started dating his first girlfriend who later becomes his wife. After convocating with his undergraduate degree in Engineering, Ryan pursued his master’s degree at NTU in Computer Science.</p>

Ryan has little in the way of savings as this stage in his life, and this is the first time he has ever looked into any type of insurance on his own.

This is a highly emotional time for Ryan as many of his accomplishments – professional, financial and personal – begin to bring him pride. As he musters up the courage to propose, Ryan is aware of the full transition he is making to adulthood.</p>
				<p>Within months of their engagement, (yes, he got the answer he was hoping for!), Ryan and Carrie submit an application for a BTO (Build-To-Order) in a less mature HDB estate.  As first-timers applying for public housing in a non-mature estate, their chances are high. Six weeks after submitting their application, Ryan and Carrie find out that they have been approved.  The couple has 4 months to sign a lease and put a down payment on the BTO flat.</p>
				<p class="bolder-text">Their combined salaries qualify them for a mortgage and thanks to Carrie’s CPF, they can easily put forward a combined down payment which consists of 5% cash (20K), and 15% CPF (60K), on a flat that costs 400K. </p>
